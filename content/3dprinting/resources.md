## 3D Printing Resources

A running list of the most useful stuff I’ve found while trying to get prints to not look like cursed spaghetti. Whether you're calibrating, troubleshooting, or just figuring out what the hell retraction actually does — these are worth checking out.

### 🧠 Guides & Knowledge Bases

- [**Prusa Knowledge Base**](https://help.prusa3d.com/)  
  Fantastic tutorials, calibration help, slicer explanations — even if you don’t use Prusa gear.

- [**Teaching Tech Calibration Guides**](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html)  
  Absolute goldmine for dialling in everything from e-steps to input shaping.

- [**Cura Docs**](https://support.ultimaker.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002077939-Cura-software)  
  If you’re using Cura, start here before guessing at random settings.

### 🛠 Forums & Help

- [**Prusa Forum**](https://forum.prusa3d.com/)  
  Super active and helpful — even the angry rants usually include solutions.

- [**r/FixMyPrint**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FixMyPrint/)  
  Post your disasters, get actual feedback. Sometimes even kind feedback.

- [**r/3Dprinting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/)  
  Big community, good for finding answers, inspiration, or just seeing what other people are breaking. (or being told "bambu lab just works" :P)

### 📺 YouTube Channels

- [**Teaching Tech**](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeachingTech)  
  Practical, clear, and surprisingly in-depth.

  Cura tips, Ender 3 fixes, and printable test files.

- [**CNC Kitchen**](https://www.youtube.com/c/CNCKitchen)  
  Print strength testing, slicing experiments, and lots of “why” behind the “what.”

Got a resource I missed? Shoot it through — or better yet, let me break my printer trying it and write about it here later.
