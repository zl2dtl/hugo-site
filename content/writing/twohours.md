We found what I called a very niche spot in the botanic gardens today, and time forgot how to move properly.

He leaned into me first, or maybe I leaned into him, it's hard to say where one gesture ended and another began. Suddenly we were cuddled on a bench, the world shrinking to the size of us.

It was perfect in a way that stays with you. The kind of thing that makes you understand what people mean when they talk about missing someone who hasn’t left. I already want more of how easy it felt, how right. The conversations didn’t need forcing, and the silences didn’t need filling.

Saying goodbye was harder than it should have been. We'd only just started, and I was already reluctant to end it, like walking away from something I'd only just discovered I needed. The hours we spent there felt both endless and not nearly enough, leaving this strange ache for a moment that’s already gone.

I keep replaying it, the lean, the ease of conversation, how leaving felt like peeling myself away from something I'd just grown into.

He's still mine. And I miss him anyway.
