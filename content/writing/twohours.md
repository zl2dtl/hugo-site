We found what I called a very niche spot in the botanic gardens today, and time forgot how to move properly.

He leaned into me first, or maybe I leaned into him, it's hard to say where one gesture ended and another began. Suddenly we were cuddled on a bench, the world shrinking to the size of us.

It was perfect in a way that stays with you. The kind of thing that makes you understand what people mean when they talk about missing someone who hasn't left. He's still mine and I already want more of this, more of how easy it felt, how right. More of the conversations that didn't need forcing, the silences that didn't need filling.

Saying goodbye was harder than it should have been. We'd only just started and I was already reluctant to end it, like walking away from something I'd just discovered I needed. The hours we spent there felt both endless and not nearly enough, and now there's this strange ache of wanting to go back to a moment that's already gone.

I keep replaying it. The lean. The ease of conversation that felt like we'd done this a thousand times before. How leaving felt like peeling myself away from something I'd just grown into.

He's still mine. And I miss him anyway.
