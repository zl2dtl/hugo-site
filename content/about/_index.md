## Hi. I'm Dan.

I made this site because I needed somewhere to dump stuff — project notes, random ideas, things that break, things that work, the occasional 2am crisis about whether I'm doing any of this right. 

This is me working through stuff. Sometimes that's technical problems, sometimes it's life problems, usually it's both mixed together because that's how my brain works.

## What's here

It's like if my workbench had a baby with my journal and then that baby got into my junk drawer. Sometimes you'll find actually useful stuff — how I fixed that thing that shouldn't have broken, why your Arduino sketch keeps crashing, a 3D model that prints without supports falling over. Other times it's me at stupid o'clock trying to work through some problem that's been eating at me for days.

There are step-by-step guides when I remember to document what I'm doing. There are half-finished projects I got excited about then abandoned. There are rants about why nothing ever works the way it's supposed to. There are probably too many photos of things that look broken but somehow aren't.

No posting schedule because that's how you kill the fun. No clean categories because that's not how my brain works. Just whatever feels worth putting out there.

## Who I am

I'm ZL2DTL — licensed amateur radio operator, which explains the URL and probably half the weird radio stuff you'll find here. I spend way too much time messing with microcontrollers, getting frustrated with OpenSCAD on Linux (only to go and run back to Fusion on Windows, while also insulting Fusion), poking at circuits that were working fine until I "improved" them, and generally building things that definitely already exist but not quite the way I want them.

Just so long as there's very little software involved — I absolutely hate writing software. Even this website that was mostly done for me was hard enough.

I like taking things apart to see how they work, then putting them back together with extra parts left over. I enjoy solving problems that probably aren't worth solving. I have strong opinions about documentation (there's never enough ever) and comments in code (there are never enough of those either, unless it's my own code in which case both my previous points are null and void).

I also overthink basically everything, write way more than anyone wants to read, and occasionally stumble backwards into something that actually works properly. This site is where all of that happens.

## Why this exists

Mostly because writing stuff down helps me figure out what I actually think about it. And because when you spend hours debugging something stupid, you might as well document it so future-you doesn't make the same mistake. Plus, every couple of months someone emails me to say a post gave them an idea which helped them fix their thing, which makes the whole exercise feel worthwhile.

But honestly? This is all for me at the end of the day. It's my way of keeping track of what I've learned, what I've screwed up, and what I'm working on next. The internet just happens to be where I'm keeping my notes. Also, I will feel very important when I can casually throw a link to my own website in casual conversation.

If something here saves you some time, or makes you feel less alone in fighting with your tech troubles (or interpersonal troubles) at half past midnight, then we're both winning.
