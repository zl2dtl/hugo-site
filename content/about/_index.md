## Hi. I'm Dan.

I made this site as a place to dump stuff — project notes, random ideas, things that break, things that work, and the occasional 2am “why is this not working?” moment.  

This is me working through problems, experimenting, and documenting what I learn along the way.

## What's here

It's like if my workbench had a baby with my journal and that baby got into my junk drawer. Sometimes you'll find actually useful stuff — how I fixed that thing that shouldn't have broken, why your Arduino sketch keeps crashing, a 3D model that prints without supports falling over. Other times it's me at stupid o'clock figuring out some technical challenge that's been bugging me for days.

There will be step-by-step guides when I remember to document what I'm doing. There might be half-finished projects I got excited about then abandoned. There may rants about why nothing ever works the way it's supposed to. And possibly too many photos of things that look broken but somehow aren't.

No posting schedule because that's how you kill the fun. No clean categories because that's not how my brain works. Just whatever feels worth putting out there.

## Who I am

I'm ZL2DTL — licensed amateur radio operator, which explains the URL and half the weird radio stuff you'll find here. I spend way too much time messing with microcontrollers, getting frustrated with OpenSCAD on Linux (only to run back to Fusion on Windows), poking at circuits that were working fine until I "improved" them, and generally building things that already exist, just not quite the way I want them.

Just so long as there's very little software involved — I absolutely hate writing software. Even this website, mostly done for me, was hard enough.

I like taking things apart to see how they work, then putting them back together with extra parts left over. I enjoy solving problems that probably aren't worth solving. I have strong opinions about documentation (there's never enough) and comments in code (never enough, unless it's my own code, then my previous points are null and void).

I overthink basically everything, write way more than anyone wants to read, and occasionally stumble into something that actually works properly. This site is where all of that happens.

## Why this exists

Mostly because writing stuff down helps me figure out what I actually think about it. And when you spend hours debugging something stubborn, you might as well document it so future-you doesn't make the same mistake. Plus, every few months someone emails to say a post gave them an idea that helped fix their project, which makes the whole exercise feel worthwhile.

But honestly? This is all for me. It's my way of keeping track of what I've learned, what I've screwed up, and what I'm working on next. The internet just happens to be where I'm keeping my notes. Also, I will feel very important when I can casually throw a link to my own website in conversation.

If something here saves you time, or makes you feel less alone while wrestling with tech, then we're both winning.
