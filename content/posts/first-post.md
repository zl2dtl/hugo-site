I'm not sure what this thing will turn into. Maybe that's fine.

This is the fourth time I've done this. Different names, different sites, different looks. Probably because what I need from it keeps changing. Sometimes it was just for keeping track of project notes. Sometimes it was where I dumped thoughts that didn't have anywhere else to go. Now it's something else, I guess.

There's stuff rattling around in my head that doesn't work as a text message or a quick photo or something you'd bring up over coffee. Some of it's quick, those ideas that disappear if you don't grab them right away. Other stuff sticks around, going in circles until I finally write it down somewhere. That somewhere is here now.

This is going to be more personal than tech, though I'll definitely write about projects and circuits and whatever I'm tinkering with. But mostly it's just mine. A place to work through things and maybe leave something useful behind. For me, mostly. Maybe for someone else too.

I'll write about the things I'm building and the things that break on me. What I try to fix and whether it actually works. But also about people (one person very specifically) and timing and those feelings you can't really name. That thing where you know something matters but you can't explain why.

So here we are. Fourth time starting over. No big speech about new beginnings or any of that this time. Just getting started again.

We'll see what happens.
