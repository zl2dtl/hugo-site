Two weeks since my last post. A month and a half since I started this iteration of the blog. The motivation comes and goes - sometimes the ideas flow freely, sometimes there's nothing but empty pages staring back at me.
I've been thinking about timing a lot lately. Turns out some of my earliest pieces of writing on my blog were about exactly that - timing and how it shapes everything. I thought I'd taken that old blog down, but apparently it still exists somewhere in the digital ether, a reminder of thoughts I had months ago that feel oddly relevant now.
The blog has become a bit of a drag to write for, if I'm being completely honest. It started with such promise - I had stories to tell, projects to document, thoughts worth sharing. But somewhere along the way, the well ran dry.
This happens with my writing sometimes - it comes and goes. Generally as I change, or people around me change, and the scenarios I'm in change, everything changes and my head goes for a bit of an overthinking rollercoaster. When the timing goes astray, my mind runs.
So I'm taking a step back. This isn't necessarily goodbye forever - hence "for now" in the title. But right now, the timing isn't right. The foundation is here, but something fundamental is off, and no amount of forcing it will make things sync up properly.
The blog feels like an obligation to myself at the moment, and that's never a good place to write from. When I feel like I'm capable of communicating and sharing again - not when I have something particularly groundbreaking to say, just when the words want to come - I'll be back. Until then, I'm parking it. Hopefully, all will be well in another few weeks. But I've got enough else to work out that I know I won't have the time to keep this going consistently for the next little while. 

Thanks for reading along on this chaotic journey so far, let's all hope this isn't the end of this project for good.
