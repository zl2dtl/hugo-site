Welcome to **Jukebox**, my personal music server powered by [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/). Itâ€™s like Spotify, only with music I actually own. 

This server is **for my personal use only**. All the music here is legally owned by me, and copyright laws mean it cannot be shared publicly. Access is limited to myself and a few close friends at my discretion (and they can only access **their** music library), strictly for private listening.  

Big thanks to Findlay at [zenoc.net](https://zenoc.net/) for hosting Navidrome and keeping everything running smoothly.
