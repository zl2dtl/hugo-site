# Self-Hosted Projects

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I run and tinker with various self-hosted services. Instead of relying on ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù, which is just a fancy way of saying "someone else's computer", I prefer keeping things close to home ‚Äî literally ‚Äî on my Intel NUC.  

That NUC might not sound like a powerhouse (10th Gen Core i3, 16GB RAM, 256GB NVMe, running Debian 12 with no DE or WM), but it pulls its weight just fine. It currently runs:  

- **[Jukebox](https://jukebox.zl2dtl.xyz)** ‚Äì my personal music server powered by [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/). Think of it as Spotify, but with music I actually own. Access is private and strictly limited.  
- **[EggSHELL Remote Terminal](https://eggshell.zl2dtl.xyz)** ‚Äì my emergency root development shell for when things inevitably break while I‚Äôm away. (No, you can‚Äôt have access. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want it when it‚Äôs on fire anyway.)  
- ~~This very website, because why not let the server introduce itself?~~ (well, actually not yet. but it'll be in the stack soon :] ) 

I‚Äôm always experimenting, so the list of self-hosted projects may grow (or implode) depending on my mood and uptime.

# My Computers

Alongside the NUC server, I‚Äôve got a few machines that keep me productive, entertained, and occasionally frustrated.  

## üñ•Ô∏è Main PC  
- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-4790 (4 cores, 8 threads) @ 4.00 GHz  
- **GPU:** NVIDIA Quadro K620 (Discrete)  
- **Memory:** 16 GB DDR3  
- **Storage:** 465 GB HDD  
- **OS:** Manjaro 25 (GNOME)  
- **Notes:** My daily driver for heavier workloads, running Linux. Solid, dependable, and still going strong despite its age. Plans to upgrade in the future with a new SSD and keep the current spinner as a backup or some additional storage. 

## üíª Dev Laptop ‚Äì ThinkPad T470  
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-7300U 
- **Memory:** 24 GB  
- **Storage:** 512 GB SSD 
- **OS:** Manjaro 25 (GNOME), Ubuntu 25.04 Desktop 
- **Notes:** My go-to for portable development work. Because it‚Äôs a ThinkPad, it‚Äôll probably survive an EMP.  

## üíª School Laptop ‚Äì Dell Latitude 5300 
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5 (8th Gen, can't be bothered to check the actual model, )  
- **Memory:** 16 GB  
- **Storage:** 256 GB SSD  
- **OS:** Windows 11 
- **Notes:** The only machine I currently run Windows on. Strictly for school use, because sometimes you just have to.
