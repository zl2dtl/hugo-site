The printers have been churning away happily, producing whatever random bits and pieces I’ve thrown at them. The new laptop continues its streak of actually working, which still feels like a minor miracle after the ThinkPad debacle.\nI’ve also been deep in the weeds with some codido ng projects, most notably working on an RPN scientific calculator app for the laptop.

But sometimes you just need to build something yourself, even if it’s reinventing a perfectly good wheel.
