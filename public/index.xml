This means I can write as much as I want, and literally push one button which runs a .bat script that pushes it to Github after prompting me only for a commit message. My server then has another script which hopefully runs every 20 minutes past the hour (3 times an hour, at :00, :20, and :40) if I wrote it correctly that should delete the old directory and automagically pull the updated copy from Github.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Two Hours That Weren't Nearly Enough</title><link>//zl2dtl.xyz/writing/twohours/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//zl2dtl.xyz/writing/twohours/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We found what I called a very niche spot in the botanic gardens today, and time forgot how to move properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leaned into me first, or maybe I leaned into him, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say where one gesture ended and another began. Suddenly we were cuddled on a bench, the world shrinking to the size of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was perfect in a way that stays with you. The kind of thing that makes you understand what people mean when they talk about missing someone who hasn’t left. I already want more of how easy it felt, how right. The conversations didn’t need forcing, and the silences didn’t need filling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3D Printing Resources</title><link>//zl2dtl.xyz/3dprinting/resources/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//zl2dtl.xyz/3dprinting/resources/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="3d-printing-resources"&gt;3D Printing Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A running list of the most useful stuff I’ve found while trying to get prints to not look like cursed spaghetti. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re calibrating, troubleshooting, or just figuring out what the hell retraction actually does — these are worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
