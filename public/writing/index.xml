      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing thrilling at all with this one, but if it&amp;rsquo;s visible after 5:40pm on 23/11/25 NZST then I have successfully implemented a much more automated workflow. This means I can write as much as I want, and literally push one button which runs a .bat script that pushes it to Github after prompting me only for a commit message. My server then has another script which hopefully runs every 20 minutes past the hour (3 times an hour, at :00, :20, and :40) if I wrote it correctly that should delete the old directory and automagically pull the updated copy from Github.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
