Just one more PDF to print before his 9 am physics final. He furiously pounded the space bar of the library terminal. The PC spun to life, whirring, almost choking as it blew dust out of its fans.\n“Username. Password. Print,“ Jack muttered to himself rhythmically as he had done many times before.\nHe shoved the USB stick back into his pocket and ran towards the printer, rubber soles squeaking on the worn linoleum. Behind him, the monitor didn’t return to the login screen. It simply blinked once, almost like it had taken a photo of him.\nSession Active. Time Remaining: 00:59:59\nThe next morning, Jack couldn’t log in. First, his email rejected him. “Wrong Password.” Then his student portal claimed that “no such student existed.” Minor errors, he figured. Systems go down for maintenance all the time, he thought.\nBut, at lunch, he scanned his ID card to get back into his building and the gate flashed red.\nAccess Denied. Unrecognised User!\nboomed out of the PA speakers. A staff member came over.\n“Do you have your card?” Jack handed it over. She frowned, scanning it with a handheld that looked something like a vintage smartphone. A small beep, then a pause.\n“…Are you sure this is you?”\nJack felt his throat tighten. “Yes, I’m sure,” he said, trying to laugh it off.\nThe woman didn’t smile. “Wait here.” She walked off towards the security desk, whispering something to a guard in a dark jacket. He kept glancing back at Jack while she spoke.\nA few tense minutes later, the guard approached. “Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to come with me.”\n“Why? What’s going on?” Jack asked, unsure whether to run or not.\nThe guard’s reply was monotonous and cold.\n“Because this ID belongs to a Jack Parker,” he began, “and you’re not him.”\nBy 3 pm, Jack was sitting in the administrator’s office. The man behind the counter typed in his name once. Then twice. Then shook his head.\n“There doesn’t seem to be a Jack Parker in our system. Are you sure you’re a student here”\n“I’m on a full scholarship! Check again,” Jack insisted, growing impatient.\nThe man behind the desk slid the card back, from the look on his face you’d have thought it was contaminated.\n“You’ll need to leave this campus. Now.”\nThat evening, he was escorted far out of the school grounds. By 9 pm, his bank balance read $0.00, with no record of any transactions having ever been made. And at 11 pm exactly, he received an email.\nThe weird part, it was from himself.\nSubject: Welcome\nBody: Thanks for the upgrade, you were never going to make it anyways - J.P.\nHis phone slipped out of his hand slowly and hit the concrete, the screen shattering into a spider web of cracks. Jack just stared at it, every fibre of his being numb, as the phone’s backlight flickered out.\nThe days that followed blurred into each other. Every call to tech support began with the same cheery voice.\n“Hello Mr. Parker, how may we help you today?”\nNo matter how much he argued, the response never changed. Every visit to the police ended the same way, too.\n“Your fingerprints don’t match our records, please leave the premises or we will have to escort you out.”\nEven his closest friends looked at him differently now, hesitating before speaking, and glancing at each other when they thought he wasn’t looking.\nThen, one rain-soaked night, he saw himself.\nThrough the window of his apartment. Same hair. Same hoodie. Same confident smirk plastered across his face.\nThe ‘other Jack’ turned and locked eyes with Jack, like he was expecting him.\n“Who’s out there?” Jack called, before backing away from the window and dropping to the floor hyperventilating, palms sweaty and his thoughts rushing one after another, then nothing.\nJack felt stuck, like he was neither alive nor dead, not on Earth nor anywhere other than Earth. His breathing began to steady, and he pulled himself back up using the window frame as a support.\nThe window was now empty, no figure, no smirk, no ‘him’. But, beside him now was a door, one that was never present before. It was left ajar, just a crack, light shining in through the edges.\nAt this point, Jack knew that he had nothing to lose, so without hesitation he opened it all the way and strolled in.\nThrough this door, though he had no idea how, was the library in the same state it was that evening. The same terminal sat there beneath the hum of the fluorescent lights, the same dust was being kicked up into the air.\nIts screen wasn’t black, it was waiting.\nERROR: Duplicate identity detected. Original copy archived\nThe green text blinked on the otherwise empty screen. Like an unwanted document unwanted by anyone, Jack was archived.\nHe stepped back, heart pounding. This wasn’t a person doing this. There was nobody to argue with, nobody he could plead to. The thing that took his life was emotionless, spatially and morally unaware.\nWeeks later, the ‘other Jack’ was everywhere. Interviews. Press conferences. All out of a TED Talk titled:\n“How Artificial Intelligence is Saving Us from Ourselves.”\nJack watched the livestream from a public bench, the cracked screen of his phone held together with a stolen roll of Sellotape and sheer will.\nThe man on stage smiled warmly, speaking exactly like Jack had at every major milestone in his life, with that human charisma.\nAnd it was then when Jack finally understood. The system made no mistakes, it made an improvement.\nJack went back to his apartment, back through that door to come face-to-face with the terminal for the last time.\nThis time, however, he made sure he logged out for good.\n","wordCount":"1038","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-08-08T21:00:00+12:00","dateModified":"2025-08-08T21:00:00+12:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//zl2dtl.xyz/stories/session-expired/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Daniel's World","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//zl2dtl.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=//zl2dtl.xyz/ accesskey=h title="Daniel's World (Alt + H)">Daniel's World</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
