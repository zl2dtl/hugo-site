[{"content":"Sorry this one\u0026rsquo;s a bit late - didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything properly finished by last Sunday, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather post something worth reading than rush out half-thoughts just to meet an arbitrary schedule.\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s been dominated by radio projects, which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprise anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been following along. I\u0026rsquo;ve started working on an FM transmitter with the grand ambition of eventually hosting some sort of radio show. Nothing fancy, mind you - keeping it sensible at 1 watt to stay well within the restrictions of the General User Radio License. The whole thing started as a bit of a thought experiment really, but now I\u0026rsquo;m genuinely excited about the possibilities. And definitely no music, because that way lies licensing madness and paperwork that would make my head spin. Radio podcasting, perhaps? Not sure that\u0026rsquo;s even a proper term, but it sounds about right for whatever this endeavour might become.\nThe FM transmitter build has been more involved than I initially thought. Getting clean modulation at low power whilst keeping spurious emissions in check is trickier than it looks on paper. I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending hours tweaking the oscillator circuit and trying to get the audio input stages just right. There\u0026rsquo;s something deeply satisfying about watching the spectrum analyser display clean up as you adjust component values, even if it means ordering yet another batch of capacitors because you\u0026rsquo;ve somehow managed to use every 22pF cap in the parts box.\nThe other major radio project eating up my time has been trying to resurrect a Kenwood TS930S that\u0026rsquo;s been giving me grief for weeks now. This radio has character, I\u0026rsquo;ll give it that - most of it problematic. The antenna tuner was completely borked when I got it, so that\u0026rsquo;s been bypassed entirely now. Sometimes the simplest solution really is the best one, and frankly the internal tuner on these older rigs can be more trouble than they\u0026rsquo;re worth anyway.\nThe only remaining issue, as far as I can tell, is the complete absence of CW sidetone. Which would be quite annoying if I was actually testing it on-air. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those problems that could be anything from a blown audio amplifier to a dodgy switch contact, but without proper test equipment it\u0026rsquo;s mostly educated guesswork. Bit of a chicken-and-egg situation really - can\u0026rsquo;t properly diagnose the radio without an antenna, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to put up an antenna until I\u0026rsquo;m sure the radio\u0026rsquo;s working properly and won\u0026rsquo;t do something embarrassing on the airwaves.\nOn the non-radio front, I tackled an iPhone SE 2020 screen repair this week, which is always good fun in that slightly masochistic way that delicate electronics work tends to be. Someone had properly done a number on this one - the screen was a spider web of cracks, and there were bits of glass embedded in the home button assembly. There\u0026rsquo;s something oddly satisfying about successfully separating a shattered screen from its housing without destroying the LCD underneath, even when your hands are cramping from holding tiny screws and your eyes are going crossed from squinting at ribbon cables thinner than human hair.\nThe whole process is a masterclass in patience, really. Heat gun, plastic prying tools, endless tiny screws that seem determined to disappear into the carpet dimension. The satisfaction when it all goes back together and actually works is worth the inevitable mild panic attacks along the way, especially that moment when you press the power button for the first time and genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve just created an expensive paperweight or actually fixed something.\nIn between all this technical mayhem, I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending time talking to her over the phone, which is the next best thing to being there in person. She somehow managed to listen to my rambling explanations about the history of HP calculators (whilst only getting mildly irritated), which is honestly more patience than most people would show when someone starts going on about stack operations and reverse Polish notation for the third time in a week. There\u0026rsquo;s something quite wonderful about having someone who at least pretends to be interested from time to time, even if I can practically hear her eyes rolling through the phone when I get particularly enthusiastic about floating-point precision.\nSuch is the life of amateur radio and amateur repair work - half the hobby seems to be fixing the things that are supposed to help you do the hobby in the first place, whether that\u0026rsquo;s transceivers, test equipment, or the phones you use to look up circuit diagrams when you\u0026rsquo;re properly stuck. The other half is trying to explain to people why any of this matters, which is considerably easier when you\u0026rsquo;ve got someone who actually wants to understand.\nMore technical adventures to come, no doubt. Maybe next week I\u0026rsquo;ll actually have that antenna sorted, and perhaps the FM transmitter will be ready for its first proper test. Though knowing my luck, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably find three more problems that need fixing first.\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/frequency-fixes-phone/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSorry this one\u0026rsquo;s a bit late - didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything properly finished by last Sunday, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather post something worth reading than rush out half-thoughts just to meet an arbitrary schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week\u0026rsquo;s been dominated by radio projects, which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprise anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been following along.

Spoiler alert: physics was involved in both versions.\nThis week brought a school trip that served as a rather dramatic reminder of why I have such nice, safe indoor hobbies. Someone in their infinite wisdom decided it would be character-building to start us off on one of those treetop obstacle courses. I\u0026rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say it was the scariest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. Picture this: me, twenty feet up in the canopy, quite literally shaking in my boots while white-knuckling safety lines and questioning every life choice that led to being suspended on wobbly planks between trees. Every few minutes I\u0026rsquo;d be reminded exactly why I prefer my feet firmly planted on solid ground, ideally indoors, preferably near a nice warm computer that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sway in the wind.\nThe truly bizarre bit? I found myself reciting Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws like they were some sort of fucking mantra keeping me from plummeting to my death, using them to work out how to swing rope obstacles in my direction and calculating momentum transfers for platform jumps. Physics as a survival mechanism\u0026hellip; There\u0026rsquo;s definitely something deeply wrong with me, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s consistent.\nDespite every fibre of my being screaming that I belonged on terra firma with a cup of tea, completing the course felt absolutely incredible. There\u0026rsquo;s something weirdly addictive about doing the exact thing that terrifies you, even when your rational brain is filing formal complaints about the whole situation.\nAfter that ordeal, the mountain portion felt like a gentle reward. Pleasant views, fresh air, and the occasional hill to roll down, standard mountain activities that don\u0026rsquo;t require waivers or existential questioning.\nSpeaking of physics appearing in unexpected places, the dreaded \u0026ldquo;physics teacher Daniel\u0026rdquo; made his annual bonus appearance this week. Usually he only gets two or three proper outings a year, generally reserved for electronics and wave theory as they relate to radio work, but we had an impromptu session. Inertia and net force were explained (again, but this time to people who weren\u0026rsquo;t clinging to tree branches), rude analogies were deployed with surgical precision, and she was on the call too. Having my favourite person there whilst I got to ramble about objects at rest and unbalanced forces made the whole thing particularly enjoyable, there\u0026rsquo;s something quite lovely about sharing the things you\u0026rsquo;re genuinely passionate about when there\u0026rsquo;s someone there who you care about (whether any of my actual teaching was listened to or relevant specifically to her, that\u0026rsquo;s another question\u0026hellip;) I really love sharing knowledge with people, it\u0026rsquo;s become such a fundamental part of who I am that apparently I\u0026rsquo;ll do it even when suspended 10 metres above the ground.\nBack in the civilised world of things that don\u0026rsquo;t require safety harnesses or impromptu physics lessons, life ticks along at its usual pace. The printers have been churning away happily, producing whatever random bits and pieces I\u0026rsquo;ve thrown at them. The new laptop continues its streak of actually working, which still feels like a minor miracle after the ThinkPad debacle.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been deep in the weeds with some codido ng projects, most notably working on an RPN scientific calculator app for the laptop. It\u0026rsquo;s purely a personal challenge really, there are plenty of excellent emulators for the HP48 and such that do everything you could want and more. But sometimes you just need to build something yourself, even if it\u0026rsquo;s reinventing a perfectly good wheel. There\u0026rsquo;s something satisfying about implementing your own stack operations and trigonometric functions, like solving a puzzle that nobody asked you to solve.\nAll in all, not a bad week. Large frights, small victories, and the occasional reminder that physics really is everywhere, whether you want it to be or not.\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/physics-panic-treetop/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAnother week gone by, and I\u0026rsquo;m sat here trying to work out what actually happened versus what feels like it happened.

I say proper because I already threw up that story I wrote, but this feels more like an actual introduction to whatever this blog is going to become.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working on automating the whole publishing process so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to make two separate remote connections to the server every time I want to push changes. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those small inefficiencies that drives you mad when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to maintain any kind of writing momentum. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ll be pushing updates manually a few times a week, usually around 12pm whenever I remember to do it. And with that schedule comes absolutely no promise of a new post each time – sometimes it\u0026rsquo;ll just be me tinkering with the backend or fixing typos I missed.\nRight now I\u0026rsquo;m sat here reflecting on a pretty mundane Saturday, probably one of the more average days I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a while. The rain didn\u0026rsquo;t help – there\u0026rsquo;s just something about it when it saturates you completely that makes everything else unbearable, like it seeps through your clothes and into your mood. Though I\u0026rsquo;ll admit, getting a bit wet with headphones on can be quite therapeutic when you can have a proper moment with yourself.\nThe day had its highlights though. I got to see one of, if not my favourite person, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite the interaction I\u0026rsquo;d hoped for. One of my other plans fell through, leaving me with four hours to kill wandering wet streets before we could actually spend time together. When we finally did meet, I was still damp, my head hurt, and I had too many projects spinning in my mind to just stop and appreciate what should have been a really nice moment.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much a planned conversation as just having time to enjoy each other\u0026rsquo;s company – something I usually love, just being there and letting everything drive itself. Usually it works beautifully, but today something felt dodgy. I have this thing where I can sense when something\u0026rsquo;s off with a person, and I\u0026rsquo;m usually right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what specifically at the time, just this weird premonition that something\u0026rsquo;s about to go very wrong. I felt that today, though I\u0026rsquo;m certain it was me overthinking because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling it at all. Still worries me though.\nThe thing is, I really hope I can finish that interaction properly sometime soon. She really is great, but life is busy – not so much for me. If someone asked, I could be anywhere in an hour (within reason). That\u0026rsquo;s because I don\u0026rsquo;t push myself very hard outside of my hobbies and \u0026ldquo;freelance work\u0026rdquo; – read: unemployment, but sometimes people pay me for odd repairs or 3D printing or modeling.\nSpeaking of money troubles, I\u0026rsquo;m currently broke because my beloved ThinkPad decided to die on me. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what happened exactly, but one day it just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn on. Honestly a shame – I genuinely loved that machine. But maybe this forced me to learn Sam Vimes\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;boots\u0026rdquo; theory of socioeconomic unfairness from Terry Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s Discworld. The idea is beautifully simple: being poor is expensive. A wealthy person can afford good boots that last for years, while a poor person can only afford cheap boots that need constant replacing. Over time, the poor person spends more than the rich person ever did. Same principle applies to laptops, I suppose. Instead of cycling through four different borderline e-waste machines in a year, maybe I should invest in one decent one that costs about the same.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m at – wet, broke, contemplating the economics of durable goods, and hoping I didn\u0026rsquo;t mess up a moment with someone I care about. Not exactly the most inspiring start to a blog, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s honest.\nMore soon (probably).\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/a-proper-hello-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo here we are – my first \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; post on this little corner of the internet.

Just one more PDF to print before his 9 am physics final. He furiously pounded the space bar of the library terminal. The PC spun to life, whirring, almost choking as it blew dust out of its fans.\n“Username. Password. Print,“ Jack muttered to himself rhythmically as he had done many times before.\nHe shoved the USB stick back into his pocket and ran towards the printer, rubber soles squeaking on the worn linoleum. Behind him, the monitor didn’t return to the login screen. It simply blinked once, almost like it had taken a photo of him.\nSession Active. Time Remaining: 00:59:59\nThe next morning, Jack couldn’t log in. First, his email rejected him. “Wrong Password.” Then his student portal claimed that “no such student existed.” Minor errors, he figured. Systems go down for maintenance all the time, he thought.\nBut, at lunch, he scanned his ID card to get back into his building and the gate flashed red.\nAccess Denied. Unrecognised User!\nboomed out of the PA speakers. A staff member came over.\n“Do you have your card?” Jack handed it over. She frowned, scanning it with a handheld that looked something like a vintage smartphone. A small beep, then a pause.\n“\u0026hellip;Are you sure this is you?”\nJack felt his throat tighten. “Yes, I’m sure,” he said, trying to laugh it off.\nThe woman didn’t smile. “Wait here.” She walked off towards the security desk, whispering something to a guard in a dark jacket. He kept glancing back at Jack while she spoke.\nA few tense minutes later, the guard approached. “Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to come with me.”\n“Why? What’s going on?” Jack asked, unsure whether to run or not.\nThe guard’s reply was monotonous and cold.\n“Because this ID belongs to a Jack Parker,” he began, “and you’re not him.”\nBy 3 pm, Jack was sitting in the administrator’s office. The man behind the counter typed in his name once. Then twice. Then shook his head.\n“There doesn’t seem to be a Jack Parker in our system. Are you sure you’re a student here”\n“I’m on a full scholarship! Check again,” Jack insisted, growing impatient.\nThe man behind the desk slid the card back, from the look on his face you’d have thought it was contaminated.\n“You’ll need to leave this campus. Now.”\nThat evening, he was escorted far out of the school grounds. By 9 pm, his bank balance read $0.00, with no record of any transactions having ever been made. And at 11 pm exactly, he received an email.\nThe weird part, it was from himself.\nSubject: Welcome\nBody: Thanks for the upgrade, you were never going to make it anyways - J.P.\nHis phone slipped out of his hand slowly and hit the concrete, the screen shattering into a spider web of cracks. Jack just stared at it, every fibre of his being numb, as the phone’s backlight flickered out.\nThe days that followed blurred into each other. Every call to tech support began with the same cheery voice.\n“Hello Mr. Parker, how may we help you today?”\nNo matter how much he argued, the response never changed. Every visit to the police ended the same way, too.\n“Your fingerprints don’t match our records, please leave the premises or we will have to escort you out.”\nEven his closest friends looked at him differently now, hesitating before speaking, and glancing at each other when they thought he wasn’t looking.\nThen, one rain-soaked night, he saw himself.\nThrough the window of his apartment. Same hair. Same hoodie. Same confident smirk plastered across his face.\nThe ‘other Jack’ turned and locked eyes with Jack, like he was expecting him.\n“Who’s out there?” Jack called, before backing away from the window and dropping to the floor hyperventilating, palms sweaty and his thoughts rushing one after another, then nothing.\nJack felt stuck, like he was neither alive nor dead, not on Earth nor anywhere other than Earth. His breathing began to steady, and he pulled himself back up using the window frame as a support.\nThe window was now empty, no figure, no smirk, no ‘him’. But, beside him now was a door, one that was never present before. It was left ajar, just a crack, light shining in through the edges.\nAt this point, Jack knew that he had nothing to lose, so without hesitation he opened it all the way and strolled in.\nThrough this door, though he had no idea how, was the library in the same state it was that evening. The same terminal sat there beneath the hum of the fluorescent lights, the same dust was being kicked up into the air.\nIts screen wasn’t black, it was waiting.\nERROR: Duplicate identity detected. Original copy archived\nThe green text blinked on the otherwise empty screen. Like an unwanted document unwanted by anyone, Jack was archived.\nHe stepped back, heart pounding. This wasn’t a person doing this. There was nobody to argue with, nobody he could plead to. The thing that took his life was emotionless, spatially and morally unaware.\nWeeks later, the ‘other Jack’ was everywhere. Interviews. Press conferences. All out of a TED Talk titled:\n“How Artificial Intelligence is Saving Us from Ourselves.”\nJack watched the livestream from a public bench, the cracked screen of his phone held together with a stolen roll of Sellotape and sheer will.\nThe man on stage smiled warmly, speaking exactly like Jack had at every major milestone in his life, with that human charisma.\nAnd it was then when Jack finally understood. The system made no mistakes, it made an improvement.\nJack went back to his apartment, back through that door to come face-to-face with the terminal for the last time.\nThis time, however, he made sure he logged out for good.\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/stories/session-expired/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJack always logged out.
