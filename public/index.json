The kind of thing that makes you understand what people mean when they talk about missing someone who hasn’t left. I already want more of how easy it felt, how right. The conversations didn’t need forcing, and the silences didn’t need filling.\nSaying goodbye was harder than it should have been. We\u0026rsquo;d only just started, and I was already reluctant to end it, like walking away from something I\u0026rsquo;d only just discovered I needed. The hours we spent there felt both endless and not nearly enough, leaving this strange ache for a moment that’s already gone.\nI keep replaying it, the lean, the ease of conversation, how leaving felt like peeling myself away from something I\u0026rsquo;d just grown into.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s still mine.
