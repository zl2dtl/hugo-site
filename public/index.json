When I\u0026rsquo;m not writing, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m up to my neck in projects that seemed like good ideas at the time.\nThe radio repair saga continues, though with a plot twist. The TS930S I\u0026rsquo;ve been wrestling with turned out to be too far gone to be economically viable to repair - it\u0026rsquo;s found a new home at one of the radio clubs now, so at least it\u0026rsquo;s not cluttering up my bench anymore. But nature abhors a vacuum, apparently, so I\u0026rsquo;ve started on a new radio repair project: an old Icom HF transceiver that\u0026rsquo;s got me properly puzzled.\nThe thing receives fine (well, maybe - hard to tell without proper testing), but has absolutely no transmit power. Yet here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker - it reports full transmit power on the display. It\u0026rsquo;s sitting there smugly telling me everything\u0026rsquo;s fine whilst producing about as much RF as a dead hamster. Either the power sensing circuit has gone completely barmy, or there\u0026rsquo;s something spectacularly wrong with the final amplifier stage. Could be anything from a bad diode to a blown final transistor that probably hasn\u0026rsquo;t been made for the last 30-odd years. Should be interesting to track down, assuming I can find a legible copy of the service manual online.\nThe bigger project eating up most of my time this week has been getting all my assorted bits and pieces self-hosted properly. For those not steeped in computer nonsense, this basically means running services on my own computers at home instead of using other people\u0026rsquo;s computers in the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo;. Hence the removal of my writing tab and the addition of the new self-hosted overview, complete with details about my main machines. This site isn\u0026rsquo;t quite ready to make the jump yet, but my Jukebox project has successfully migrated over.\nFor those wondering, Jukebox is my \u0026ldquo;un-Spotify Spotify\u0026rdquo; - basically a way to host my own CD rips and such (for personal use, obviously, because laws and all that) with a rather nicer interface than just browsing folders full of MP3s. It\u0026rsquo;s coming along nicely, and I\u0026rsquo;ve written up a brief overview on the new tab with a link to the open-source project that\u0026rsquo;s powering the whole thing. There\u0026rsquo;s something quite satisfying about having your own music collection properly organised and accessible from anywhere in the house.\nGetting all this set up has meant configuring a computer as a proper server and reimaging my desktop with a fresh Linux distro. It\u0026rsquo;s been a lot, frankly. Add to that the Prusa needing a service and the ThinkPad requiring a fan clean (because of course it did), and you\u0026rsquo;ve got a week that\u0026rsquo;s been wall-to-wall technical faff.\nSpeaking of the Prusa, I seem to have entered my 3D designing pen pots era, which is either a sign of productive organisation or complete procrastination - haven\u0026rsquo;t decided which yet. I\u0026rsquo;ve made myself a perfectly sized organiser for my pens, wire brushes, and markers that actually fits properly on my desk for once. More interestingly, I designed a pen pot based on a roughly copied model of the cervical vertebrae for someone important enough to be worth at least four hours of my life spent getting the geometry just right. Quite fun actually, working out the internal structure and making sure it would actually hold pens without toppling over. Maybe my future is in biomedical engineering after all? Though knowing me, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have moved on to designing something completely different by next week.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not all been resistors and RAM upgrades. On the personal side, it\u0026rsquo;s been another week of proper reflection and daydreaming. About life, about the future, but more importantly about right now. Been thinking about how great my future could be, but that\u0026rsquo;s rather pointless if now isn\u0026rsquo;t also a place where I want to be. Where exactly is that separation between now and the future anyway? Feels like one of those questions that sounds profound until you actually try to pin it down. And will it really be better in the future, or does reaching each milestone just open up more questions, more things to worry about? Some people seem to know exactly what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do with their lives - they\u0026rsquo;ve got it all mapped out, degree to career to retirement plan. Meanwhile, I\u0026rsquo;m sat here with absolutely no idea still. That\u0026rsquo;s honestly because I have too many ideas rather than too few. If I could be a doctor and an engineer and a software developer all at the same time, I\u0026rsquo;d probably give it a go. Seems trivial when you write it down like that, but stuff like this is genuinely what keeps me up at night. How do you choose one path when there are so many interesting things to explore?\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;ve been this week - knee-deep in servers and existential questions in roughly equal measure. The radio will get fixed eventually, the servers will hopefully stay running, and the big questions will probably still be there next week.\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/servers-signals-reflection/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA week without a post, which you know means a properly busy week for me.

I\u0026rsquo;ve started working on an FM transmitter with the grand ambition of eventually hosting some sort of radio show. Nothing fancy, mind you - keeping it sensible at 1 watt to stay well within the restrictions of the General User Radio License. The whole thing started as a bit of a thought experiment really, but now I\u0026rsquo;m genuinely excited about the possibilities. And definitely no music, because that way lies licensing madness and paperwork that would make my head spin. Radio podcasting, perhaps? Not sure that\u0026rsquo;s even a proper term, but it sounds about right for whatever this endeavour might become.\nThe FM transmitter build has been more involved than I initially thought. Getting clean modulation at low power whilst keeping spurious emissions in check is trickier than it looks on paper. I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending hours tweaking the oscillator circuit and trying to get the audio input stages just right. There\u0026rsquo;s something deeply satisfying about watching the spectrum analyser display clean up as you adjust component values, even if it means ordering yet another batch of capacitors because you\u0026rsquo;ve somehow managed to use every 22pF cap in the parts box.\nThe other major radio project eating up my time has been trying to resurrect a Kenwood TS930S that\u0026rsquo;s been giving me grief for weeks now. This radio has character, I\u0026rsquo;ll give it that - most of it problematic. The antenna tuner was completely borked when I got it, so that\u0026rsquo;s been bypassed entirely now. Sometimes the simplest solution really is the best one, and frankly the internal tuner on these older rigs can be more trouble than they\u0026rsquo;re worth anyway.\nThe only remaining issue, as far as I can tell, is the complete absence of CW sidetone. Which would be quite annoying if I was actually testing it on-air. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those problems that could be anything from a blown audio amplifier to a dodgy switch contact, but without proper test equipment it\u0026rsquo;s mostly educated guesswork. Bit of a chicken-and-egg situation really - can\u0026rsquo;t properly diagnose the radio without an antenna, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to put up an antenna until I\u0026rsquo;m sure the radio\u0026rsquo;s working properly and won\u0026rsquo;t do something embarrassing on the airwaves.\nOn the non-radio front, I tackled an iPhone SE 2020 screen repair this week, which is always good fun in that slightly masochistic way that delicate electronics work tends to be. Someone had properly done a number on this one - the screen was a spider web of cracks, and there were bits of glass embedded in the home button assembly. There\u0026rsquo;s something oddly satisfying about successfully separating a shattered screen from its housing without destroying the LCD underneath, even when your hands are cramping from holding tiny screws and your eyes are going crossed from squinting at ribbon cables thinner than human hair.\nThe whole process is a masterclass in patience, really. Heat gun, plastic prying tools, endless tiny screws that seem determined to disappear into the carpet dimension. The satisfaction when it all goes back together and actually works is worth the inevitable mild panic attacks along the way, especially that moment when you press the power button for the first time and genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve just created an expensive paperweight or actually fixed something.\nIn between all this technical mayhem, I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending time talking to her over the phone, which is the next best thing to being there in person. She somehow managed to listen to my rambling explanations about the history of HP calculators (whilst only getting mildly irritated), which is honestly more patience than most people would show when someone starts going on about stack operations and reverse Polish notation for the third time in a week. There\u0026rsquo;s something quite wonderful about having someone who at least pretends to be interested from time to time, even if I can practically hear her eyes rolling through the phone when I get particularly enthusiastic about floating-point precision.\nSuch is the life of amateur radio and amateur repair work - half the hobby seems to be fixing the things that are supposed to help you do the hobby in the first place, whether that\u0026rsquo;s transceivers, test equipment, or the phones you use to look up circuit diagrams when you\u0026rsquo;re properly stuck. The other half is trying to explain to people why any of this matters, which is considerably easier when you\u0026rsquo;ve got someone who actually wants to understand.\nMore technical adventures to come, no doubt. Maybe next week I\u0026rsquo;ll actually have that antenna sorted, and perhaps the FM transmitter will be ready for its first proper test. Though knowing my luck, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably find three more problems that need fixing first.\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/frequency-fixes-phone/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSorry this one\u0026rsquo;s a bit late - didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything properly finished by last Sunday, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather post something worth reading than rush out half-thoughts just to meet an arbitrary schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week\u0026rsquo;s been dominated by radio projects, which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprise anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been following along.

Spoiler alert: physics was involved in both versions.\nThis week brought a school trip that served as a rather dramatic reminder of why I have such nice, safe indoor hobbies. Someone in their infinite wisdom decided it would be character-building to start us off on one of those treetop obstacle courses. I\u0026rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say it was the scariest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. Picture this: me, twenty feet up in the canopy, quite literally shaking in my boots while white-knuckling safety lines and questioning every life choice that led to being suspended on wobbly planks between trees. Every few minutes I\u0026rsquo;d be reminded exactly why I prefer my feet firmly planted on solid ground, ideally indoors, preferably near a nice warm computer that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sway in the wind.\nThe truly bizarre bit? I found myself reciting Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws like they were some sort of fucking mantra keeping me from plummeting to my death, using them to work out how to swing rope obstacles in my direction and calculating momentum transfers for platform jumps. Physics as a survival mechanism\u0026hellip; There\u0026rsquo;s definitely something deeply wrong with me, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s consistent.\nDespite every fibre of my being screaming that I belonged on terra firma with a cup of tea, completing the course felt absolutely incredible. There\u0026rsquo;s something weirdly addictive about doing the exact thing that terrifies you, even when your rational brain is filing formal complaints about the whole situation.\nAfter that ordeal, the mountain portion felt like a gentle reward. Pleasant views, fresh air, and the occasional hill to roll down, standard mountain activities that don\u0026rsquo;t require waivers or existential questioning.\nSpeaking of physics appearing in unexpected places, the dreaded \u0026ldquo;physics teacher Daniel\u0026rdquo; made his annual bonus appearance this week. Usually he only gets two or three proper outings a year, generally reserved for electronics and wave theory as they relate to radio work, but we had an impromptu session. Inertia and net force were explained (again, but this time to people who weren\u0026rsquo;t clinging to tree branches), rude analogies were deployed with surgical precision, and she was on the call too. Having my favourite person there whilst I got to ramble about objects at rest and unbalanced forces made the whole thing particularly enjoyable, there\u0026rsquo;s something quite lovely about sharing the things you\u0026rsquo;re genuinely passionate about when there\u0026rsquo;s someone there who you care about (whether any of my actual teaching was listened to or relevant specifically to her, that\u0026rsquo;s another question\u0026hellip;) I really love sharing knowledge with people, it\u0026rsquo;s become such a fundamental part of who I am that apparently I\u0026rsquo;ll do it even when suspended 10 metres above the ground.\nBack in the civilised world of things that don\u0026rsquo;t require safety harnesses or impromptu physics lessons, life ticks along at its usual pace. The printers have been churning away happily, producing whatever random bits and pieces I\u0026rsquo;ve thrown at them. The new laptop continues its streak of actually working, which still feels like a minor miracle after the ThinkPad debacle.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been deep in the weeds with some codido ng projects, most notably working on an RPN scientific calculator app for the laptop. It\u0026rsquo;s purely a personal challenge really, there are plenty of excellent emulators for the HP48 and such that do everything you could want and more. But sometimes you just need to build something yourself, even if it\u0026rsquo;s reinventing a perfectly good wheel. There\u0026rsquo;s something satisfying about implementing your own stack operations and trigonometric functions, like solving a puzzle that nobody asked you to solve.\nAll in all, not a bad week. Large frights, small victories, and the occasional reminder that physics really is everywhere, whether you want it to be or not.\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/physics-panic-treetop/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAnother week gone by, and I\u0026rsquo;m sat here trying to work out what actually happened versus what feels like it happened.

I say proper because I already threw up that story I wrote, but this feels more like an actual introduction to whatever this blog is going to become.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working on automating the whole publishing process so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to make two separate remote connections to the server every time I want to push changes. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those small inefficiencies that drives you mad when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to maintain any kind of writing momentum. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ll be pushing updates manually a few times a week, usually around 12pm whenever I remember to do it. And with that schedule comes absolutely no promise of a new post each time – sometimes it\u0026rsquo;ll just be me tinkering with the backend or fixing typos I missed.\nRight now I\u0026rsquo;m sat here reflecting on a pretty mundane Saturday, probably one of the more average days I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a while. The rain didn\u0026rsquo;t help – there\u0026rsquo;s just something about it when it saturates you completely that makes everything else unbearable, like it seeps through your clothes and into your mood. Though I\u0026rsquo;ll admit, getting a bit wet with headphones on can be quite therapeutic when you can have a proper moment with yourself.\nThe day had its highlights though. I got to see one of, if not my favourite person, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite the interaction I\u0026rsquo;d hoped for. One of my other plans fell through, leaving me with four hours to kill wandering wet streets before we could actually spend time together. When we finally did meet, I was still damp, my head hurt, and I had too many projects spinning in my mind to just stop and appreciate what should have been a really nice moment.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much a planned conversation as just having time to enjoy each other\u0026rsquo;s company – something I usually love, just being there and letting everything drive itself. Usually it works beautifully, but today something felt dodgy. I have this thing where I can sense when something\u0026rsquo;s off with a person, and I\u0026rsquo;m usually right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what specifically at the time, just this weird premonition that something\u0026rsquo;s about to go very wrong. I felt that today, though I\u0026rsquo;m certain it was me overthinking because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling it at all. Still worries me though.\nThe thing is, I really hope I can finish that interaction properly sometime soon. She really is great, but life is busy – not so much for me. If someone asked, I could be anywhere in an hour (within reason). That\u0026rsquo;s because I don\u0026rsquo;t push myself very hard outside of my hobbies and \u0026ldquo;freelance work\u0026rdquo; – read: unemployment, but sometimes people pay me for odd repairs or 3D printing or modeling.\nSpeaking of money troubles, I\u0026rsquo;m currently broke because my beloved ThinkPad decided to die on me. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what happened exactly, but one day it just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn on. Honestly a shame – I genuinely loved that machine. But maybe this forced me to learn Sam Vimes\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;boots\u0026rdquo; theory of socioeconomic unfairness from Terry Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s Discworld. The idea is beautifully simple: being poor is expensive. A wealthy person can afford good boots that last for years, while a poor person can only afford cheap boots that need constant replacing. Over time, the poor person spends more than the rich person ever did. Same principle applies to laptops, I suppose. Instead of cycling through four different borderline e-waste machines in a year, maybe I should invest in one decent one that costs about the same.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m at – wet, broke, contemplating the economics of durable goods, and hoping I didn\u0026rsquo;t mess up a moment with someone I care about. Not exactly the most inspiring start to a blog, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s honest.\nMore soon (probably).\n73, Daniel\n","permalink":"//zl2dtl.xyz/posts/a-proper-hello-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo here we are – my first \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; post on this little corner of the internet.
