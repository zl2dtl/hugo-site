This means I can write as much as I want, and literally push one button which runs a .bat script that pushes it to Github after prompting me only for a commit message.

Must have scripted it wrong somehow. I\u0026rsquo;m honestly more inclined to make a comically large physical update button at this point\u0026hellip; The upside is now everything is technically automated, or at least I have to think less and I can just run two scripts to upload a new update.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/writing/automationtest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNothing thrilling at all with this one, but if it\u0026rsquo;s visible after 5:40pm on 23/11/25 NZST then I have successfully implemented a much more automated workflow.
